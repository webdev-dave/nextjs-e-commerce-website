# E-Commerce App

## Todo

- Allow uploading multiple product images per product (need to change how db handles product photos. currently only expects 1)
- Create an Admin Logout button (& auto logout after 1 hour of no browser activity)
- Create auth for users (allow google auth or email:password setup)

### Potential Features

- Allow user to input richtext and store in DB with correct markdown
- Add a shopping cart
- Add a Shadcn Data Table for admin AdminProductsPage and hookup all data table features to product data
- If there is ever a use case for a complex form, use Shadcn "Form" component
- Handle Product Image Storage on Another Server, instead only store links to images in website DB
